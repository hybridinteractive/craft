## Using percipioglobal/craft

This project package works exactly the way Pixel & Tonic's [craftcms/craft](https://github.com/craftcms/craft) package works; you create a new project by first creating & installing the project:

    composer create-project percipioglobal/craft PATH

Make sure that `PATH` is the path to your project, including the name you want for the project, e.g.:

    composer create-project percipioglobal/craft craft3

## Setting Up Local Dev

You'll need Docker desktop for your platform installed to run the project in local development

* Set up a `.env` file in the `cms/` directory, based off of the provided `example.env`
* Set up a `.env.sh.` file in the `scripts/` directory, based off of the provided `example.env.sh`
* Start up the site with `docker-compose up` (the first build will be somewhat lengthy)
* Import the `seed_db.sql` database dump the first time from the `scripts/` dir with `./docker_restore_db.sh seed_db.sql`
* Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to use the site; the `webpack-dev-server` runs off of `http://localhost:8080`

The CP login credentials are initially set as follows:

Login: `hi@hybridinteractive.io` \
Password: `letmein`

**Important:** To find the correct credentials for `LOCAL_DB_CONTAINER` run `docker-compose up` and once the docker container is running, use the command `docker container ls` to find the correct name of the container.
If your project is called `test` the container will be somewhere along the lines of `test_mariadb` or `test_mysql`. That's the value you do have to enter.

**N.B.:** Without authorization & credentials (which are private), the `./docker_pull_db.sh` will not work. It's provided here for instructional purposes

To update to the latest Composer packages (as constrained by the `cms/composer.json` semvers), do:
```
rm cms/composer.lock
docker-compose up
```

To update to the latest npm packages (as constrained by the `docker-config/webpack-dev-craft/package.json` semvers), do:
```
rm docker-config/webpack-dev-craft/package-lock.json
docker-compose up
```

To use Xdebug with VSCode install the [PHP Debug extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=felixfbecker.php-debug ) and use the following configuration:
```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Listen for Xdebug",
            "type": "php",
            "request": "launch",
            "port": 9001,
            "log": true,
            "externalConsole": false,
            "pathMappings": {
                "/var/www/project/cms": "${workspaceRoot}/cms"
            },
            "ignore": ["**/vendor/**/*.php"]
        }
    ]
}
```

## Running Craft CLI commands

Since we are using docker to run our project, we need to execute the craft CLI commands prepended with the docker command `docker-compose exec php`, eg: `docker-compose exec php ./craft project-config/sync`.

## Updating Composer Packages

Run the following command to update your composer packages to the latest version: `docker-compose exec php composer update`
